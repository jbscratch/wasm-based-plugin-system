# Wasm based plugin system 

Idea: Have a wasm executable file together with a webcomponent for some settings ui stuff packaged as an npm repo 

## Useful Stuff 

- Install Packages to npm workspace packages: `npm i -D assemblyscript -w plugin-a`
- Init Assemblyscript package in plugin-a folder: `cd packages/plugin-a && npx asinit .`
